# Weather Prediction using Ridge Regression

This repository contains the implementation of a weather prediction model using Ridge Regression. The goal of this project is to predict weather patterns based on historical data using the Ridge Regression algorithm.


## Implementation

The notebook contains a detailed walkthrough of the implementation, results and next steps: [Google Colab notebook](https://github.com/shrutin567/Weather-Prediction/blob/main/ridge_regression_model.ipynb).


## Data set

The data set use for training and testing the model can be found [here](data/weather.csv).
