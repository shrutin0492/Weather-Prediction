# Weather Prediction using Ridge Regression

This repository contains the implementation of a weather prediction model using Ridge Regression. The goal of this project is to predict weather patterns based on historical data using the Ridge Regression algorithm.

## Introduction
Weather prediction is an important area of study that helps us understand and anticipate atmospheric conditions. Machine learning techniques have shown promise in predicting weather patterns based on historical data. Ridge Regression, a variant of linear regression, can be utilized to create a weather prediction model that takes into account various input features to make accurate predictions.

In this project, we explore the implementation of a weather prediction model using Ridge Regression. The goal is to understand how this algorithm can be applied to weather data and evaluate its performance in predicting weather conditions.

## Implementation
The implementation of the weather prediction model using Ridge Regression is done in the Jupyter Notebook titled [ridge_regression_model.ipynb](https://github.com/shrutin567/Weather-Prediction/blob/main/ridge_regression_model.ipynb). The notebook is contains explanation regarding all the steps.

## Google Colab Notebook
The notebook contains a detailed walkthrough of the implementation, results and next steps: [Google Colab notebook](https://github.com/shrutin567/Weather-Prediction/blob/main/ridge_regression_model.ipynb).

## Data set
The data set use for training and testing the model can be found [here](data/weather.csv).
